Note: This is an observational study so there isn't random assignment which means only causal inferences can be drawn.

How does the enviornment affect the performance metrics?
    Elivation on pit times

    Follow up data gathering idea: Gather weather data (percipitation, temperature, humidity, wind)

How much does qualifying postion matter in predicting results?
    lm(results~qualifying, raceDataFrame)

How much does the constructor (is constructor the accepted term?) matter in predicting results?
    lm(results~constructor, raceDataFrame)

How much does the driver matter in predicting results?
    lm(results~driverID, raceDataFrame)

What was the final model we decided on for predicting a race winner?
    lm(results~attribute1 + attribute2 + ..., raceDataFrame)
